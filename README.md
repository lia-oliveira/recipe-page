## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- Media Queries


### What I learned

I learned a lot from this project, and I will highlight two key points below:

1. How to make list markers stay inside the container.
```css
ul, ol {
  list-style-position: inside;
}
```

2. How to use a selector that applies styles to the first child of a specific type.

```css
.container > p:first-of-type {
  /* property: value; */
}
```


### Continued development

I plan to study ways to automate the calculation of margins, paddings, and other measurements, at least during the development phase. Using the CSS calc() function could be a good approach, as recalculating everything manually after each change is tedious and unproductive.

Additionally, I need a Pro account on Frontend Mentor. Not having access to the Figma files makes even simple projects like this take considerably more time to complete.
